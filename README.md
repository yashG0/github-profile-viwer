# Github Profiler app

My project, "github_profiler," appears to be a static website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It likely serves as a GitHub profile viewer or analyzer, allowing users to input a GitHub username and view information about that user's repositories, activity, or other GitHub-related data. It may also include features like displaying repositories, followers, following, and possibly some analysis or visualization of the user's GitHub data. If you have specific questions or need help with this project, feel free to ask!
